# Classification-of-Sound
- Objective : To classify sounds into music, speech and silence using MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient) features
- Used sliding window to split the audio files into smaller chunks and extracted MFCC features for audio using librosa
- Developed various Machine Learning models such as Feedforward, CNN, RNN, LSTM with accuracy of 84% âˆ’ 95%
